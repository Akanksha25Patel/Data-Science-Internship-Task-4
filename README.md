Data Science Internship – February 2026

This repository contains solutions for Task 4: Functions with Loops. The project includes multiple real-world Python problems such as mobile recharge validation, inventory reorder alerts, student result processing, cab fare estimation, attendance eligibility checking, and password strength validation.

All programs are implemented using functions, loops, and proper validation logic. The code is clean, well-structured, and documented with comments for better understanding.
